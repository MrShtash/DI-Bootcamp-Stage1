          Alexander was born in 1985 in Moscow. Alexander is the third and
          youngest child in the family. From early childhood, the boy became
          interested in hockey, and from the age of 8 he began to go to the
          profile section thanks to his older brother. The mother of the future
          hockey player, the famous basketball player Tatyana Ovechkina,
          defender of the USSR national team. As part of the national team, she
          became a two-time Olympic champion. Father, Mikhail – a former
          professional footballer, played for the capital “Dynamo”. Parents did
          not want Sasha to be fond of such unsafe sports, moreover, the boy had
          to stop exercising, since his relatives could not take him to
          training. Alexander was helped to return to his vocation by the coach,
          who was convinced that Ovechkin was a born hockey player, and
          persuaded his parents not to miss such prospects. More details
